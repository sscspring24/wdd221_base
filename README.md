# Starter Template for WDD221 Classwork

Hello and Welcome!

Welcome to WDD221 Web Development with JavaScript (JS). Throughout this semester we will be working on labs, challenges and guided activities that allow us to learn and practice new techniques and the wonderful world of JS.

For this class, you will be expected to add all of your completed work (challenges, guided activites and labs) to this Git Repo. Each week you will need to add your new code and ensure you are **COMITTING** and **PUSHING** your changes to GitHub.

When we push our work to GitHub our repository will be linked up to a free webhosting service to allow us to see our changes published on the web.

Please feel free to add any addtional folders, and files you need to help make this website more personalized. 

Looking forward to a great semester!

Chris
